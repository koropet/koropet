ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @koropet

I'm working as civil engineer for more than 5 years. In my work processes I use some plugins that I wrote along these years and they are really helping me and my collegues.
Also I really interesting in developing of OpenGL graphics apllications, some little games and other activities.
The main technology that I working with is a .NET framework and C# language. Also I have some old progects in VBA. Other way to programming is models for TrumGame, where you can write
parametric geometry and appearance of trum models that using in game.

A big opportunity to realize myself I see in BIM technology. It has a large clusters of geterogenic data that have been to work with, compute, exchange, visualize, and more ither.
It must help to improve processes of developing buildings and structures.

ðŸŒ± I'm currently working on these projects:
- PKUserTools - a library of useful functions for autocad like table recognizing, rapid text editing, Excel interoperabelity and more other.
- GraphicsTest - is a project to discover abilities of OpenGL Shading Language and to write own shader, that will imitate TrumGame shading model.
